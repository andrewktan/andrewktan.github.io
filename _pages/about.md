I'm primarily interested in the physics of computation and the physics of learning.
In practice, this means I draw inspiration from (quantum) information theory, statistical physics, machine learning, and occasionally biophysics.
And typically publish in venues focused on either quantum information or machine learning.

I'm currently working towards my doctorate in the physics at [MIT](https://physics.mit.edu/).
I completed my BASc in [Engineering Physics](https://engsci.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto.
I've completed internships at Google and [Intel PSG](https://www.intel.ca/content/www/ca/en/products/programmable.html).

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat!
